                <h3>Aim</h3>
                <p>
                    Develop a predictive model for a task in historical
                    linguistics. Possible tasks include semantic, morphological,
                    or phonological prediction. The project should be linked to
                    phylogenetic trees (e.g., Glottolog).

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    This project would be research oriented. It falls within the
                    field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly as
                    applied to historical linguistics. Indeed, much research in
                    historical linguistics has traditionally been carried out
                    manually (before computational tools were available). Recent
                    advances in NLP would make it possible to adopt a more
                    computational, faster, and systematic approach. More
                    specifically, my project is motivated by the reading of two
                    doctoral theses (Fourrier, 2022, and Dekker, 2018), whose
                    methodologies I will explain in the following section).

                <h3>Expected results</h3>
                <p>
                    To define what I aim to accomplish with this project, I rely
                    on the dissertations of Fourrier (2022) and Dekker (2018).
                    These researchers train machine learning models to predict
                    cognates—that is, words sharing a common etymology (for
                    example, the French word “porte” and the Italian “porta”,
                    both derived from the Latin “porta”). The model must, given
                    a cognate in one language, predict the corresponding cognate
                    in another language (for instance, if the input is “porte”
                    labeled as French, the model should predict “porta” when
                    presented with the label Italian).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Dekker’s thesis, he attempts to reconstruct phylogenetic
                    trees of languages based on his models’ performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of my project would therefore be to train models
                    performing tasks of this nature (either replicating an
                    existing task or defining a new one), and possibly to
                    examine the theoretical implications of my results.
