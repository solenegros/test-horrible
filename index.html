                    <p>
                        I’m an Solène Gros, an undergraduate student at PSL
                        University in the CPES Sciences des données arts et
                        cultures (Data sciences, Arts and Cultures). I’m
                        interested in linguistics and Machine Learning.

                    <h3>About my project</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project is about cognate prediction. Cognates
                        arewords that are connected by a common ancestor. For
                        example the words “pièce” (French), “peth” (Welch),
                        “piece” (English), “piesă" (Romanian), or “cuid” (Irish)
                        are all cognates since they descend from proto Celtic
                        *kʷezdis. The goal of this project is to predict a
                        cognate from a target language based on a cognate from
                        asource language (for example, with English as the
                        source and Welsh as the target, we want to predict
                        “peth” based on “piece”). I will use neural networks to
                        do the cognate prediction task.
